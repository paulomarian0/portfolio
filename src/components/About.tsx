			<p className="paragraph mb-6">
				I'm a passionate software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer
				Science. My journey in software development began with a fascination for
				how technology works, leading me to specialize in JavaScript,
				TypeScript, React, and Node.js, while also mastering .NET. I focus on
				building modern, scalable, and accessible applications that deliver
				seamless user experiences.
			</p>
			<p className="paragraph mb-6">
				I am deeply interested in AI and its potential to enhance user
				experiences and solve complex problems. My approach to development is
				centered on writing clean, maintainable code and continuously exploring
				new technologies to stay ahead of the curve. I believe in creating
				impactful solutions that prioritize accessibility and user-centered
				design.
			</p>
			<p className="paragraph">
				In my free time, I enjoy playing non-competitive single-player and
				multiplayer games with my fianc√©e, as well as watching a good series.
				Being a Brazilian, I am a native Portuguese speaker, fluent in English,
				and have an advanced level of Spanish. I believe diverse experiences,
				both personal and professional, help me approach problems in creative
				ways and enrich my work as a developer.
